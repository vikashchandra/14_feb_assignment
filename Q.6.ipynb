    "Q.6.  Explain deadlocks and race conditions.\n",
    "Solution: Deadlocks and race conditions are two common \n",
    "synchronization issues that can occur in concurrent or \n",
    "multi-threaded software programs. They both involve\n",
    "situations where multiple threads or processes are trying \n",
    "to access shared resources, but they can lead to different\n",
    "types of problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deadlock:\n",
    "A deadlock is a situation in which two or more threads\n",
    "or processes are unable to proceed because each is waiting\n",
    "for the other to release a resource or take some action.\n",
    "This results in a standstill where no progress can be made.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deadlocks typically involve the following conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutual Exclusion: Processes or threads must request \n",
    "exclusive access to resources, meaning only one can \n",
    "use the resource at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hold and Wait: A process or thread holds one or more \n",
    "resources while waiting to acquire additional resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "No Preemption: Resources cannot be forcibly taken away\n",
    "from a process or thread. They can only be released\n",
    "voluntarily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Circular Wait: There must be a circular chain of processes, \n",
    "where each process is waiting for a resource held by the \n",
    "next process in the chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deadlocks can be challenging to detect and resolve.\n",
    "To prevent deadlocks, developers can use various\n",
    "techniques such as resource allocation graphs, timeouts, \n",
    "and avoiding circular dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Race Condition:\n",
    "\n",
    "A race condition is a situation where the behavior of a \n",
    "program depends on the relative timing of events, particularly\n",
    "when multiple threads or processes access shared resources\n",
    "without proper synchronization. Race conditions can result\n",
    "in unpredictable and undesirable outcomes, as different \n",
    "threads can interfere with each other. Common race conditions \n",
    "occur due to:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lack of Synchronization: Threads do not use synchronization\n",
    "mechanisms (e.g., locks, semaphores) to coordinate their \n",
    "access to shared resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unpredictable Timing: The order in which threads execute and \n",
    "access shared resources can vary, leading to different program \n",
    "outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uncertain Results: Race conditions can lead to data corruption, \n",
    "crashes, or other unintended behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent race conditions, developers should use synchronization\n",
    "mechanisms that ensure exclusive access to shared resources \n",
    "and establish a clear and predictable order of execution among\n",
    "threads, such as mutexes or semaphores. Proper synchronization\n",
    "helps avoid conflicts and ensures that the program functions \n",
    "correctly in a multi-threaded environment.\n",
